#send-it

##what
send-it lets you define http requests and the responses they should yield. it's nifty for front-end testing as we can safely rely on our back-end to provide us with the appropriate responses in production, but we don't want to make 'real' requests and create fake data during testing. we also don't want to wait for every live request as it makes running tests horribly inefficient. SOâ€¦ send-it lets you make mock requests to your own local server to save time and heartache
